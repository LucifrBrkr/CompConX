cause of events,

4* but, i really wanted to play 'It takes Two'...  
5* so i did wht you'd do, but controllers would empty my allowance... :/  
6* so i turned my second laptop into my controller, Hence born CompConX... ;)  

keyPoints.exe... :#    
*Processing, to map key inputs from laptop2  
*1st arduino to recieve the keyValues from processing through Serial  
*2nd arduino {bruh emulates an XBOX controller through XInput}, recieves the keyValues, maps it to XBOX controls, sends commands to laptop1  
*laptop1 is dumb enough to think it's a controller... :/  

note: standalone-USB capable arduino's must be used...leonardo used here.
